Implement a comprehensive book recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to logged-in users through multiple recommendation strategies.

## Features to Implement

### 1. Top-rated Books Recommendations
- Display personalized top-rated book recommendations for logged-in users
- Implement filtering options (limit, genre)
- Show relevance score and recommendation reason for each book
- Handle cases where users have insufficient reading history

### 2. Similar Books Recommendations
- Create a section for books similar to user's favorites
- Implement genre-based matching and preference scoring
- Allow users to filter by specific genres
- Display similarity metrics and explanation of why books were recommended

### 3. AI-powered Recommendations
- Integrate with OpenAI-based recommendation API
- Create a dedicated UI section for AI-powered recommendations
- Implement cache awareness (show when recommendations were last refreshed)
- Build proper fallback UI when AI recommendations are unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### Service Integration
- Create a recommendation service that integrates with the backend API
- Implement proper authentication with JWT tokens
- Handle all recommendation types: "top_rated", "similar", "ai"
- Process and display response data including fallback information

### User Interface
- Design a tabbed interface for different recommendation types
- Implement skeleton loading states during API calls
- Create responsive grid/list views for recommendations
- Show relevant book details (title, author, genres, ratings)
- Display recommendation reasons and relevance scores
- Implement refresh mechanism with cooldown period

### Error Handling
- Create user-friendly error messages for API failures
- Implement fallback UI when recommendation strategies fail
- Handle authentication errors and redirect to login if needed
- Provide feedback for rate limiting or service unavailability

### Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for recommendation results
- Add pagination or infinite scroll for large recommendation sets
- Optimize image loading for book covers
- Use memoization for recommendation processing

## API Integration Details

The recommendation service offers the following endpoints:
- `POST /v1/recommendations` - Get recommendations with specified strategy

- Reading history is considered in recommendations

### AI-powered Recommendations
- Users can access AI-generated recommendations
- System falls back gracefully to "similar" when AI is unavailable
- UI indicates when recommendations were last refreshed
- Cache mechanism is properly implemented

### General Requirements
- All recommendation features are only available to logged-in users
- UI is responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- Loading states are displayed during API calls
- Error states are handled gracefully with proper user feedback
- Recommendation UI follows the application's design system

## Implementation Notes

This feature will require:
1. New recommendation service in the services directory
2. New components for recommendation display
3. Integration with authentication system
4. State management for recommendation preferences
5. Testing strategy for all components

Do not implement the features yet. This task is for planning purposes only.
